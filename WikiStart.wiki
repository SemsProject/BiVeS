The [bives:wiki BiVeS Framework] is probably the resource you want to use in your project. It is executable from command line (it contains a [source:src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/bives/Main.java  Main]) and combines all BiVeS modules (see right hand side dependency graph):
* [bives-core:wiki BiVeS-Core]
* [bives-cellml:wiki BiVeS-CellML]
* [bives-sbml:wiki BiVeS-SBML]

In addition, we provide a [bivesws:wiki web service] which uses BiVeS to provide all functionalities through JSON calls, and a [bivesws-client:wiki web service client library] which is able to communicate with the web service.

All these modules utilize the [xmlutils:wiki xmlutils] project, which provides advanced features for handling XML trees.

Include the BiVeS Framework via Maven: ([http://mvn.sems.uni-rostock.de/releases/de/unirostock/sems/BiVeS/ find latest version id], import the [https://sems.uni-rostock.de/2013/10/maven-repository/ SEMS Maven repository])
