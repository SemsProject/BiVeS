= BiVeS API =

The BiVeS API provides some easy way to compare two computational models.

The base API is defined in the bives-core:wiki:API, which is extended by
* the bives-sbml:wiki:SBML-API to handle SBML models
* the bives-cellml:wiki:CellML-API to handle CellML models

To get a better understanding of the usage of BiVeS within Java projects you might also want to have a look at https://sems.uni-rostock.de/trac/bives/browser/src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/bives/Executer.java wich makes use of these APIs.
